# CodeWarsCSharpTrain
My CodeWars C# (CSharp) study file.

### The 11th of November, 2017
I have completed [Microsoft C# Quick Start](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/quick-starts/index) and wanna try my possibilities.

This repository will represent you my solves in [CodeWars](codewars.com). I want to look at my code in 3 months, 6 months... and look at my progress.
